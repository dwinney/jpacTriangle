</p>
The goal is the evaluation of the diagram above with arbitrary external spin *J* of the decaying particle, spin-projection *j* in the s-channel and exchanged particle of spin *j'* in the t-channel.


Requires ROOT (tested with version 6.17).

### Executables
To build any example codes in the /executable/ directly, for example `test.cpp`, use:
```
